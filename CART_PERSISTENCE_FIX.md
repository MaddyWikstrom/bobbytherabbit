# Cart Persistence Fix

## Issue Fixed
Previously, the cart was being cleared immediately when redirecting to the Shopify checkout page. This meant that if a user clicked "Back" from the checkout page, they would find their cart empty and would need to re-add all items.

## Solution Implemented

The fix preserves cart contents until an order is actually completed:

1. **Removed Premature Cart Clearing**:
   - Modified `cart.js` to stop clearing cart contents immediately when redirecting to checkout
   - Also fixed the same issue in `checkout-fix.js` which had a separate implementation
   - Instead, we now store a flag in sessionStorage indicating checkout is in progress

2. **Added Checkout State Tracking**:
   - When redirecting to Shopify checkout (from either cart.js, bobby-checkout-storefront.js, or checkout-fix.js), a flag is set in sessionStorage
   - When loading the cart, we check for this flag to detect if a user is returning from checkout

3. **Added Order Completion Handler**:
   - Added new `handleOrderCompleted()` methods in both CartManager and SilentCheckoutSystem classes
   - These methods properly clear the cart only after confirmation that the order was placed

## How It Works Now

1. User adds items to cart
2. User clicks "Checkout"
3. The checkout process begins and user is redirected to Shopify checkout
4. If user clicks "Back" or abandons checkout:
   - They return to the site with all their cart items intact
   - They can continue shopping or adjust cart contents
5. If user completes their order:
   - The cart will remain until explicitly cleared upon order confirmation
   - Call `cartManager.handleOrderCompleted()` to clear the cart after confirmed order

## Implementation Details

- Uses sessionStorage to track checkout state between page navigations
- Preserves cart contents in localStorage until order completion
- Works with both the regular cart checkout and Storefront API checkout methods
