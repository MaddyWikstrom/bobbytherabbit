# Prevent Cart UI from Clearing During Checkout

## Issue Fixed
When clicking the checkout button, the cart was visually clearing immediately on the main site page, even though the items were still being sent to the Shopify checkout. This made it appear like the cart was empty when clicking back from checkout.

## Solution Implemented

The fix maintains the visual cart UI during the entire checkout process:

1. **Preserves Visual Cart State**:
   - New script (`prevent-cart-ui-clear.js`) that specifically targets the UI aspect
   - Takes a snapshot of the cart UI state when checkout is clicked
   - Actively prevents the cart from visually appearing empty during checkout

2. **DOM Observation and Restoration**:
   - Uses MutationObserver to watch for cart UI changes in real-time
   - Immediately restores the cart UI if it detects it being cleared
   - Maintains cart count indicators so they don't disappear

3. **Multiple Protection Layers**:
   - `prevent-cart-ui-clear.js` - Focuses on the visual UI aspect
   - `prevent-checkout-clear.js` - Prevents actual cart data clearing
   - `back-button-cart-fix.js` - Handles back button navigation

## How It Works Now

1. User adds items to cart on bobbytherabbit.com
2. User clicks "Checkout"
3. The cart items remain visually present in the UI (not cleared)
4. Items are sent to Shopify checkout page
5. If user clicks back:
   - Cart items are still visually present in the UI
   - No disruption to the shopping experience

## Technical Implementation

The solution specifically addresses the visual cart clearing by:
1. Preserving cart HTML when checkout is clicked
2. Watching for DOM changes that would clear the cart
3. Immediately restoring the cart UI if it gets cleared
4. Running periodic checks to ensure cart UI stays intact

This focuses on preventing the visible UI disruption that was occurring between clicking checkout and the actual redirect to Shopify.
