# Cart Persistence Fix (Cross-Domain Version)

## Issue Fixed
Previously, the cart was being cleared when redirecting to the Shopify checkout page. When users clicked "Back" from the checkout page, they would find their cart empty and would need to re-add all items. This was particularly challenging because the main site is on bobbytherabbit.com while the Shopify checkout is on mfdkk3-7g.myshopify.com.

## Solution Implemented

The fix preserves cart contents even when navigating between different domains:

1. **Created a Cross-Domain Cart Persistence System**:
   - New standalone script (`cross-domain-cart.js`) that specifically handles domain transitions
   - Uses localStorage instead of sessionStorage for cross-domain persistence
   - Detects when a user is returning from the Shopify checkout domain

2. **Multiple Protection Mechanisms**:
   - Proactive cart backup before checkout using localStorage
   - Referrer detection to identify returns from Shopify domain
   - Timestamp tracking to identify checkout sessions
   - Multiple cart restoration methods for different cart systems

3. **Universal Compatibility**:
   - Works across domain boundaries (bobbytherabbit.com â†” mfdkk3-7g.myshopify.com)
   - Compatible with all cart implementations (CartManager, BobbyCart)
   - Works with all checkout methods (regular checkout, Storefront API)
   - Added to all HTML files for complete site protection

## How It Works Now

1. User adds items to cart on bobbytherabbit.com
2. User clicks "Checkout"
3. The CrossDomainCart system creates a backup in localStorage
4. User is redirected to Shopify checkout (mfdkk3-7g.myshopify.com)
5. If user clicks "Back" or abandons checkout:
   - System detects they're returning from the Shopify domain
   - Cart items are automatically restored from localStorage
   - Shopping experience continues seamlessly with all items intact
6. If user completes their order:
   - The backup is only cleared when explicitly told the order is complete

## Implementation Details

- Uses localStorage which persists across domains and sessions
- Checks document.referrer to detect returns from Shopify domain
- Uses timestamps to identify active checkout sessions
- Provides multiple restoration methods for different cart implementations
- Added to all HTML files to ensure site-wide protection
