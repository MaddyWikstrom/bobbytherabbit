# Back Button Cart Fix

## Issue Fixed
The cart was being cleared when redirecting to the Shopify checkout page. When users clicked the back button from the checkout page, they would find their cart empty and would need to re-add all items. This issue was specifically happening during navigation between bobbytherabbit.com and mfdkk3-7g.myshopify.com domains.

## Solution Implemented

The fix implements a targeted approach specifically designed to handle the back button scenario:

1. **Focused Back Button Detection**:
   - New standalone script (`back-button-cart-fix.js`) loaded early in the page lifecycle
   - Specialized detection of browser back button events using both history state and referrer checks
   - Direct interception of checkout buttons and form submissions

2. **Robust Backup & Restoration Strategy**:
   - Automatic cart backup to localStorage before checkout redirects
   - Multiple restoration approaches targeting different cart implementations
   - Periodic backup to ensure no cart data is lost even without explicit checkout

3. **Cross-Domain Compatibility**:
   - Uses localStorage instead of sessionStorage to persist data across domains
   - Detects navigation between bobbytherabbit.com and mfdkk3-7g.myshopify.com
   - Multiple detection mechanisms to ensure reliable operation in all browsers

## How It Works Now

1. When a user visits any page, the script immediately loads and checks if they're returning from checkout
2. Before checkout, the cart is automatically backed up to localStorage
3. When the user clicks the back button after checkout:
   - The system detects the back navigation through browser history state or referrer checks
   - Cart items are immediately restored from the backup
   - The cart UI is updated to show the restored items

## Testing

A special test page has been created to verify the fix:
- `test-back-button-fix.html` - Allows testing the cart backup and restoration without going through actual checkout
- Provides simulation of checkout and back button behavior
- Shows real-time state of localStorage and cart contents

## Implementation Details

- Script is loaded at the top of each page to ensure it runs before other cart logic
- Uses multiple cart detection and restoration methods for maximum compatibility
- Directly intercepts all checkout events site-wide
- Added to all main HTML files (index.html, cart.html, products.html)
