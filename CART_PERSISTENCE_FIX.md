# Prevent Cart Clearing During Checkout

## Issue Fixed
The cart was being cleared immediately when clicking the checkout button, before even getting to the Shopify checkout page. This premature clearing is why when users clicked back from checkout, they would find their cart empty and would need to re-add all items.

## Solution Implemented

The fix directly prevents the cart from being cleared during the checkout process:

1. **Intercepts Cart Clearing Operations**:
   - New standalone script (`prevent-checkout-clear.js`) loaded at the very top of each page
   - Directly overrides localStorage operations to prevent cart data from being cleared
   - Intercepts all cart management methods that might clear the cart

2. **Comprehensive Protection**:
   - Monitors and blocks all potential cart clearing pathways:
     - Prevents `localStorage.setItem()` from clearing the cart key
     - Prevents `localStorage.removeItem()` from removing the cart key
     - Prevents `localStorage.clear()` from clearing the cart data
     - Overrides cart manager's `clearCart()` methods

3. **Multiple System Compatibility**:
   - Works with all cart implementations on the site:
     - CartManager
     - BobbyCheckoutStorefront
     - BobbyCart
   - Automatic backup and restoration as a failsafe

## How It Works Now

1. User adds items to cart on bobbytherabbit.com
2. User clicks "Checkout"
3. The system prevents the cart from being cleared during checkout
4. User is redirected to Shopify checkout (mfdkk3-7g.myshopify.com)
5. If user clicks back from checkout:
   - Cart items are still there since they were never cleared
   - Shopping experience continues seamlessly with all items intact

## Combined Approach

This solution works alongside the previously implemented back button fix:
- `prevent-checkout-clear.js` - Prevents the cart from being cleared in the first place
- `back-button-cart-fix.js` - Provides a backup restoration mechanism if clearing somehow occurs

## Implementation Details

- Overrides native localStorage methods to protect cart data
- Intercepts all cart clearing operations from any source
- Creates backups before any potentially destructive operations
- Loaded before all other scripts to ensure it catches all operations
- Added to all main HTML files (index.html, cart.html, products.html)
