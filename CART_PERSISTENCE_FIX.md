# Cart Persistence Fix

## Issue Fixed
Previously, the cart was being cleared immediately when redirecting to the Shopify checkout page. This meant that if a user clicked "Back" from the checkout page, they would find their cart empty and would need to re-add all items.

## Solution Implemented

The fix preserves cart contents until an order is actually completed using a dedicated cart persistence system:

1. **Created a Dedicated Cart Persistence System**:
   - New standalone script (`cart-persistence.js`) that works with any cart implementation
   - Directly backs up the entire cart before checkout and restores it when returning from checkout
   - Automatically hooks into all checkout methods across different implementations

2. **Multiple Layer Protection**:
   - Fixed the premature cart clearing in original cart implementations (`cart.js`, `checkout-fix.js`, and `bobby-checkout-storefront.js`)
   - Added a robust backup/restore mechanism that operates independently of the cart implementation
   - Implemented session-based state tracking to detect when a user is returning from checkout

3. **Universal Compatibility**:
   - Works with both CartManager and BobbyCart systems
   - Compatible with multiple checkout methods (regular checkout, Storefront API)
   - Added to all relevant HTML files for site-wide protection

## How It Works Now

1. User adds items to cart
2. User clicks "Checkout"
3. The CartPersistenceSystem automatically backs up the cart to sessionStorage
4. User is redirected to Shopify checkout
5. If user clicks "Back" or abandons checkout:
   - CartPersistenceSystem detects they're returning from checkout
   - The system automatically restores their cart items
   - They can continue shopping with all items intact
6. If user completes their order:
   - The cart backup is only cleared when explicitly told the order is complete
   - This ensures cart persistence until the purchase is finalized

## Implementation Details

- Uses sessionStorage for robust backup of cart data
- Automatically hooks into all checkout methods via function overriding
- Designed to work with any cart implementation through a unified API
- Added to all HTML files to ensure site-wide protection
