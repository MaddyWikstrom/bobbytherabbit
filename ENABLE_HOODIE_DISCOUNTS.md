# üéØ Enable Hoodie/Sweatshirt/Sweatpants Discounts

## ‚úÖ Current Status: NO DISCOUNTS ACTIVE

The system is now in **safe mode** - NO products will show discounts until you explicitly configure them.

## üîß How to Enable 12% Discount for Specific Products

### Step 1: Find Your Product IDs

You need to identify the exact product IDs for your hoodies, sweatshirts, and sweatpants.

**Method 1: Check Shopify Admin**
1. Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Products
2. Click on a hoodie/sweatshirt product
3. Look at the URL: `...products/PRODUCT_ID`
4. Copy that ID

**Method 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Add a hoodie to cart
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for messages like: `‚ÑπÔ∏è No discount applied to: [Product Name]`
4. Note the product name/ID

### Step 2: Configure Discounts

Edit `scripts/precise-discount-system.js` and find this section:

```javascript
discountEligibleProducts: {
    // Add specific product IDs or handles that should have discounts
    // Format: 'product-id': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off' }
    
    // Example hoodie products that should be on sale
    // You'll need to replace these with actual product IDs from your Shopify store
    'hoodie-black': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off hoodies' },
    'hoodie-navy': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off hoodies' },
    'hoodie-charcoal': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off hoodies' },
    'sweatshirt-vintage': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off sweatshirts' },
    'sweatpants-black': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off sweatpants' }
},
```

**Replace the example IDs with your actual product IDs:**

```javascript
discountEligibleProducts: {
    // Replace these with your actual Shopify product IDs
    'your-actual-hoodie-id-1': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off hoodies' },
    'your-actual-hoodie-id-2': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off hoodies' },
    'your-actual-sweatshirt-id-1': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off sweatshirts' },
    'your-actual-sweatpants-id-1': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off sweatpants' },
},
```

### Step 3: Test the Configuration

1. **Refresh your website**
2. **Add a hoodie to cart** (should show 12% discount)
3. **Add a t-shirt to cart** (should NOT show discount)
4. **Check console logs** for confirmation:
   - `üéØ Applying 12% discount to: [Hoodie Name]`
   - `‚ÑπÔ∏è No discount applied to: [T-shirt Name]`

## üìù Example Configuration

Here's how to set up discounts for specific products:

```javascript
discountEligibleProducts: {
    // Hoodies that should be 12% off
    '7234567890123': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off hoodies' },
    '7234567890124': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off hoodies' },
    
    // Sweatshirts that should be 12% off  
    '7234567890125': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off sweatshirts' },
    
    // Sweatpants that should be 12% off
    '7234567890126': { percentage: 12, description: '12% off sweatpants' },
},
```
