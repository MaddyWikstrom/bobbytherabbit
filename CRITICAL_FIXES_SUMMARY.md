# Critical E-commerce Platform Fixes Summary

This document outlines the critical fixes implemented to resolve persistent issues with the Bobby Streetwear e-commerce platform.

## 1. Mobile Navigation Drawer Implementation

**Issue:** The navigation drawer was completely non-functional across all devices and browsers.

**Solution:**
- Implemented a robust mobile navigation drawer system in `scripts/mobile-navigation.js`

- Incorporated smooth animations and transitions for a better user experience
- Ensured proper event handling for opening/closing the drawer
- Added accessibility features including keyboard navigation and focus management
- Preserved the site's cyberpunk aesthetic in the mobile interface

**Key Features:**
- Hamburger menu toggle in the navbar for mobile devices
- Sliding drawer animation with backdrop overlay
- Touch-friendly menu items with visual feedback
- Proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Automatic closing when clicking menu items or outside the drawer

## 2. Product Image Loading Fix

**Issue:** Product images were failing to load properly throughout the website, particularly in shopping cart and checkout pages.

**Solution:**
- Created an enhanced image loading system in `scripts/image-loader-fix.js`
- Implemented multi-level fallback strategies for failed image loads
- Added elegant placeholders for images that cannot be loaded
- Set up automatic detection and enhancement of dynamically added images

- Set up automatic redirection via netlify.toml configuration

**Key Features:**

- Better handling of Shopify API responses
- Loading indicators and state management during checkout
- Proper cleanup of cart data after successful checkout creation
