# ðŸ”¥ Simple 12% Off Implementation - COMPLETE!

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

I've successfully added the **Simple 12% Off Display System** to all your main pages:

### Files Added:
- **[`scripts/simple-12-percent-off.js`](scripts/simple-12-percent-off.js:1)** - Main JavaScript that applies 12% off to ALL products

### What Customers See:
1. **Red discount badge** in top-right corner: "-12% WEEKEND FLASH SALE"
2. **Original price crossed out** in gray with red line
3. **Sale price highlighted** in green and larger
