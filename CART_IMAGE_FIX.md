# Cart Image Loading Fix

## Problem Description

The cart system was experiencing a critical issue where product images were not displaying properly in the shopping cart drawer. This issue was affecting the user experience across the site, particularly during the checkout process.

### Root Causes:

1. **Image URL Handling Mismatch**: The cart system was incorrectly handling Shopify CDN URLs, resulting in broken image paths.
2. **Missing Cross-Reference System**: The cart wasn't properly accessing product data from different sources (product.js, homepage-products.js).
3. **Ineffective Fallback Mechanism**: The image error recovery system wasn't able to find suitable alternative images.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Product Image Extraction

The `extractProductImage` function in `cart-checkout-system.js` was completely overhauled to:

- Check the global product mapping first for direct access to product data
- Preserve Shopify CDN URLs when found (not attempting to "clean" them)
- Add additional checks for image data attributes used in the homepage products
- Better handle all types of image paths (relative, absolute, CDN)

### 2. Improved URL Cleaning Logic

The `cleanImageUrl` function was improved to:

- Preserve Shopify CDN URLs (never modifying them)
- Better handle relative and absolute paths
- Fix domain duplication issues without breaking valid image paths

### 3. Robust Fallback System

The `tryAlternativeImageSources` function was enhanced to:

- Check product mappings first for direct access to product images
- Look for matching products in the homepage product loader
- Try alternative product images from the same product when available
- Use a more comprehensive list of fallback paths including direct Shopify CDN URLs
- Better error recovery for different types of image paths

### 4. Global Product Data Access

Modified `product.js` to make product mapping globally available via `window.PRODUCT_MAPPING`, enabling direct access from the cart system.

## Testing

A test page (`test-cart-image-fix.html`) was created to verify the fixes. This page:

- Loads products directly from product.js
- Tests adding products to cart
- Verifies images load correctly in the cart
- Provides diagnostic information for any remaining issues

## Implementation Details

The solution maintains the existing cart system structure while enhancing its image handling capabilities. By creating proper connections between the product data sources and the cart system, we've ensured that images are correctly referenced and displayed throughout the shopping experience.

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Customers can now see product images in their cart, reducing confusion and cart abandonment.
- **Increased Reliability**: Multiple fallback mechanisms ensure images display even if the primary source fails.
- **Better Error Recovery**: Even if an image fails to load, the system will try alternative sources automatically.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: The code is now more robust and easier to maintain with clearer error handling.
