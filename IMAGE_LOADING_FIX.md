# Universal Image Loading Fix

## Problem
The site was experiencing "Image failed to load" errors, specifically for URLs like `https://bobbytherabbit.com/products.html`. This was caused by the `image-loader-fix.js` script which had hardcoded domain restrictions that incorrectly identified valid image URLs as invalid.

## Root Cause
The original `image-loader-fix.js` contained these problematic patterns:
```javascript
const invalidPatterns = [
    'product.html',
    'products.html',
    '.html?id=',
    'bobbytherabbit.com/products',  // ‚Üê This was causing the issue
    'bobbytherabbit.com/product',
    '/product?',
    '/products?'
];
```

Any image URL containing `bobbytherabbit.com/products` was being flagged as invalid and replaced with a placeholder, causing legitimate images to fail.

## Solution
Created a new **Universal Image Loader** (`scripts/universal-image-loader.js`) that provides:

### üéØ Agnostic Image Validation
- Uses file extension detection instead of domain-based restrictions
- Supports common image formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.svg`, `.bmp`, `.ico`
- Only blocks obvious non-image files (`.html`, `.php`, `.js`, etc.)
- No hardcoded domain restrictions

### üîÑ Smart Retry Logic
- Automatically retries failed images up to 2 times
- 1-second delay between retry attempts
- Graceful fallback to placeholder if all retries fail

### üñºÔ∏è Robust Fallback System
- Primary: Featured image from Shopify
- Secondary: First regular product image
- Tertiary: First variant image
- Final: Local placeholder (`assets/product-placeholder.png`)

### üîç Dynamic Image Monitoring
- Watches for new images added to the DOM
- Automatically applies error handling to dynamically loaded content
- Prevents duplicate processing with `data-universal-loader` attribute

## Files Updated

### New Files
- `scripts/universal-image-loader.js` - The new agnostic image loading system

### Modified Files
- `products.html` - Replaced `image-loader-fix.js` with `universal-image-loader.js`
- `product.html` - Replaced `image-loader-fix.js` with `universal-image-loader.js`
- `index.html` - Replaced `image-loader-fix.js` with `universal-image-loader.js`
- `scripts/shopify-product-loader.js` - Enhanced image selection logic with validation

## Key Features

### ‚úÖ Environment Agnostic
- Works with any domain (local, staging, production)
- No hardcoded URL patterns or domain restrictions
- Adapts to different hosting environments

### ‚úÖ Shopify Integration
- Enhanced product image selection in `shopify-product-loader.js`
- Validates image URLs before using them
- Filters out obvious page URLs (`.html`, `/products?`, `/product?`)

### ‚úÖ Performance Optimized
- Lazy error handling (only processes images that actually fail)
- Efficient DOM observation for new images
- Minimal overhead for successful image loads

### ‚úÖ Developer Friendly
- Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- Manual refresh function: `window.UniversalImageLoader.refreshAllImages()`
- Clear error messages and status updates

## Usage

The Universal Image Loader initializes automatically when the DOM loads. For manual control:

```javascript
// Refresh all images (useful for debugging)
window.UniversalImageLoader.refreshAllImages();

// Check if a URL is considered valid
window.UniversalImageLoader.isValidImageUrl('https://example.com/image.jpg');
```

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates Domain-Specific Issues**: No more hardcoded domain restrictions
2. **Improves User Experience**: Images load reliably with smart fallbacks
3. **Reduces Maintenance**: Works across different environments without changes
4. **Better Error Handling**: Retry logic reduces temporary loading failures
5. **Future Proof**: Adapts to new image sources and CDNs automatically

This fix resolves the "Image failed to load" error while providing a robust, agnostic solution that will work reliably across all environments.
