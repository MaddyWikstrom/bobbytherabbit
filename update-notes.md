# Hoodie Image Display Issue Analysis

After examining the Shopify API response for the hoodie product, I've identified why we're having issues with the "Vintage Black" and "Charcoal Gray" color variants.

## Issue Identification

When we look at the API response for "bungi-x-bobby-rabbit-hardware-unisex-hoodie", we can see:

1. For "Vintage Black" color:
   - Only ONE image URL appears in the response: `unisex-premium-hoodie-vintage-black-front-683f9d11c724f.png`
   - This is only the FRONT view image
   - No back views or side views are included in the API response
   - The same URL appears 5 times (once for each size variant)

2. Similarly for "Charcoal Heather" color:
   - Only ONE image URL appears: `unisex-premium-hoodie-charcoal-heather-front-683f9d11bbc17.png`
   - This is only the FRONT view image
   - No back views or side views are included in the API response
   - The same URL appears 6 times (once for each size variant)

3. In contrast, other colors like "Black" have multiple image angles:
   - front view
   - back view
   - left view
   - right view
   - product details

## Root Cause

Our code is working correctly, but **the API response does not contain back/side views for these specific colors**. This explains why:
- We can see these images in Shopify admin
- But they don't appear in the site, regardless of our filtering logic

## Recommendation

The solution is not in our filtering code, but rather in ensuring the Shopify API response includes all images for all color variants. 

Options:
1. Check Shopify product settings to ensure all images are associated with all color variants
2. Consider modifying the Shopify product structure to ensure all angles are included for all colors
3. If needed, use the Shopify Admin API to manually update the image associations for these products

Our previous approach of modifying the image filtering code can't solve this problem because we can't filter for images that aren't being sent in the API response.
