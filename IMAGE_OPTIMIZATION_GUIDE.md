# Image Optimization Instructions

## 🎯 Critical Issue
Your Lighthouse audit shows "Serve images in next-gen formats" could save **56.04 seconds**!
This is the main cause of your poor Largest Contentful Paint (37.8s).

## 🛠️ Required Actions

### 1. Convert Images to WebP Format
Use an online converter or tool to convert these critical images:

**High Priority (affecting LCP):**
- `assets/bobby-logo.svg` → `assets/optimized/bobby-logo.webp`
- `assets/featured-hoodie.svg` → `assets/optimized/featured-hoodie.webp`
- `assets/cookie_high.png` → `assets/optimized/cookie_high.webp`

**Medium Priority:**
- `assets/tee-1.png` → `assets/optimized/tee-1.webp`
- `assets/pants-1.png` → `assets/optimized/pants-1.webp`
- All other PNG/JPG files in assets/

### 2. Online Tools for Conversion
- **Squoosh.app** (Google's tool): https://squoosh.app/
- **CloudConvert**: https://cloudconvert.com/
- **TinyPNG**: https://tinypng.com/

### 3. Recommended Settings
- **Quality**: 80-85% for photos, 90-95% for graphics
- **Format**: WebP
- **Resize**: Create multiple sizes if needed

### 4. File Structure
Create this structure:
```
assets/
├── optimized/
│   ├── bobby-logo.webp (small: ~5KB)
│   ├── featured-hoodie.webp (medium: ~20KB)
│   ├── cookie_high.webp (small: ~10KB)
│   ├── tee-1.webp (medium: ~15KB)
│   └── pants-1.webp (medium: ~15KB)
└── (original files as fallbacks)
```

## 📊 Expected Improvements
After image optimization:
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: 37.8s → **~2s** (95% improvement)
- **Speed Index**: 10.4s → **~3s** (70% improvement)
- **Overall Performance Score**: Should reach **85-90+**

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Convert images using online tools
2. Upload to assets/optimized/ folder
3. Run the image-optimized deployment script
4. Test with new Lighthouse audit

The image optimization will have the biggest impact on your performance!
